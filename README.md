# Week1
This project focuses on predicting solar power output by building a machine learning model using linear regression. The model estimates solar power generation based on key environmental and operational factors such as temperature, sunlight intensity, and panel orientation.

Key Features:
Linear Regression Model: Developed and trained a linear regression model to accurately predict solar power output.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared raw data for analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore data trends and visualize model predictions.
Evaluation: Measured model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to ensure high accuracy.


Technologies Used:
Linear Regression
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

This project showcases the application of linear regression in renewable energy forecasting, enabling better optimization of solar panel performance and energy management strategies.

This emphasizes the use of linear regression as the core technique in your project.
